Coursera: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers Module 2 Coding Assignment Completed.

https://github.com/Razakhan2240/Coursera-test/edit/main/README.md

Hurrah! You have to do some coding! Exciting!

Time to complete: 1-2 hours. If you absorb the material in this module well, it may take less time.

If you get stuck, ask in the discussions! We're all learning, and getting stuck and unstuck (even with someone's help) can be a very valuable learning experience!

Don't be alarmed by the number of points below. It's really not that much. I wanted to explain everything as clearly as possible and break it down into smaller steps.

Here's what you'll need to complete the quest:

(If you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and the repository you'll be using for this class.

(If you haven't done so already) Follow the instructions in the development setup video (start of module 1) to create a repository and set it up to host and view your finished website on GitHub, i.e. GitHub.io domain name. You will need to enter this URL for your peer review.

Create a folder in your repository that will serve as the container folder for your solution to this task. You can call it whatever you want. For example module2-solution or mod2_solution etc. Create an index.html file in the solution container folder eg module2-solution/index.html.

The implementation of the page you will create should follow the mockup illustrations below. You have 3 mockups available: computer, tablet and mobile. Your implementation must ONLY be 1 page, NOT 3 pages. In other words, you will be creating a single responsive page.

Your page must contain a CSS file. No inline styles are allowed. Your CSS file should be placed in the css folder in the solution container folder, eg module2-solution/css.

You MUST NOT use any CSS (or Javascript) framework for this assignment, including the Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework. There should also be no references to any CSS framework files in your index.html, even if you don't use them. However, you CAN use the simple responsive framework we developed in Lecture 24 as a starting point for this assignment.

You need to implement the following breakpoints to be considered for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. The browser should display the desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992 pixels or more. The tablet view should only appear if the width of the browser window is between 768 and 991 pixels inclusive. The mobile view should only appear if the browser width is equal to or less than 767 pixels.

Your site is very simple. It consists of a page title and 3 sections (all in one line in desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. The layout of the sections on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use the media queries described in Lecture 23.)

Layout: In desktop view (992 pixels and above), each of the 3 parts should take up the same amount of screen space. As you enlarge or shrink the browser window, each section should expand or shrink. (Hint: use percentages to define the width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference to this view, see the Desktop Mockup image below.

Layout: In a tablet view (768 to 991 pixels inclusive), the first 2 sections should be on the first line and should be the same size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and occupy the entire row by itself. For a visual reference to this view, see the tablet mockup image below.

Layout: In a mobile view (equal to or less than 767 pixels), each section should occupy an entire row. For a visual reference to this view, see the mobile model image below.

Section Title Area: Every section should have a section title area that is always located in the top right corner of the section regardless of the display (desktop, tablet, or mobile). Copy the names from the mockup illustration (eg Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.)

Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the layout illustrations. Note the spacing between sections (horizontal and vertical). Notice the horizontal gap between the edges of the slice and the edges of the browser window. Also notice the space between the dummy text in each section and the section border. Finally, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough to not overlap the section title area. (Hint: use margins and padding, and use border-box as the border size as shown in lecture 19.)

Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set to some color (of your choice). Set the background color of each section title area to some unique color (of your choice). Make sure the background color still allows the user to see the text in the section title and section title areas. Depending on the color you choose, you may want to change the color of the text to make it easy to read. Set a black border on both the section title and section title area to be 1 pixel thick. Warning: While not specifying borders and colors as required won't hurt your grade that much, if you don't, it will be much harder for your classmates to grade the rest of your assignment, which could result in a much lower grade.
